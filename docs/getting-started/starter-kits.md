# Quick Start

Getting started building a new app can be a daunting task. The development world moves at lightning
speed but don't worry! We work hard to make it as simple as possible to start by maintaining
a bunch of starter kits and our community builds a lot more.

Pick the stack and platform that works for you. We have already built the scaffolding to get you started in seconds.

## [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

React is the hot topic in web development. It is a component based framework specifically designed
to create powerful & performant user interfaces. It is supported by Facebook and is backed
by a huge community. It also fits perfectly with GraphQL :)

## [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)

Angular is a web and mobile development framework that came out of Google. It promotes bi-directional
data binding and is great for building real-time apps. Angular2 is brand new and ready for you
to start building on.

## [Vue 2](https://vuejs.org/)

Vue 2 is a *progressive* Javascript view framework that is designed to have a light footprint and be incrementally adoptable. Vue 2 combines templating (like Angular) with a reactive Virtual DOM rendering engine based on VDOM for amazing rendering performance (x2 React).

Vue 2 can also be used to develop cross platform native apps via [Apache Weex](https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex). See this [Tuturial](http://weex.apache.org/guide/)

## [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

<img src="/images/quickstart/reactnative.svg" alt="React Native is the future of mobile development" style="width: 100px; height: 100px" />

React Native is the new way to build mobile apps. You write your code once with
Javascript and your app is automatically converted to native code and deployed so you can create rich experiences on any platform.

## [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/)

The GraphQL type system fits in perfectly with your swift projects. Its magic watching xcode
autocomplete and type check your GraphQL queries. Apollo iOS is a great place to start.

## [Android](https://developer.android.com/index.html)

GraphQL tooling on Android is young but is well on its way to being the best way to build Android apps.
